I"º<p>You ask, why can you not access our IRC-server (K/+r). The answers are very likely to be found here.</p>

<h2 id="1-you-should-run-identd-auth-rfc1413">1) You SHOULD run identd (auth, RFC1413)</h2>
<p>If you do not run an ident-service (on port 113), it will be too complex to work out the persons actually misusing the service. Practically this means the whole host is likely to get restricted.</p>

<p>The easiest way of avoiding this is installing identd. Or asking your local site-administrator or security-coordinator to open it up for you.</p>

<p>Running it also points out you actually care who is using your service.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s basically a bit like wearing tidy clothes. People may like you more if you do, even that very few are likely to force you to.</p>

<h2 id="2-you-must-make-sure-your-reverse-dns-ptr-works-together-with-your-in-a">2) You MUST make sure your reverse-DNS (PTR) works together with your IN A</h2>
<p>In English: Your hostname should always resolve when accessing our IRC- servers.</p>

<p>If you are not the network-administrator yourself, e-mail him/her and ask him to enable it. There are no reasons not to. Only reasons <em>to</em> do it.</p>

<p>Having a working DNS also points out that:</p>

<p>Your hostname was intended for actual usage and itâ€™s not just somebody taking advantage of an unused IP to abuse it.
Your ISP cares (and might even handle some of the abuse).
Your ISP is competent. If it doesnâ€™t even know how to run a DNS-server, which is one of the most basic services on the Net, it has no business accessing our services, either.</p>

<h2 id="3-your-geographical-location-should-match-the-top-level-domain-tld">3) Your geographical location SHOULD match the top-level domain (TLD)</h2>
<p>In English: If you are Finnish, you should be dot-FI.</p>

<p>As having a United Kingdom domain-name under Finnish IP-blocks is very unlikely to have a real purpose, it is often assumed you may either be trying to fake somebody else or simply do not understand the concept of TLDs.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you are just trying to impress somebody. Bad idea. Words should work better than silly domains.</p>

<p>That could also be an idea to add: If you are restricted or K:lined on a foreign server, it shouldnâ€™t be much of an issue for you. Itâ€™s trivial to retrieve a list of local servers in your region - /links *.TLD *.TLD</p>

<h2 id="4-your-hostname-should-serve-a-purpose">4) Your hostname SHOULD serve a purpose</h2>
<p>In English: A hostname like â€˜this.sux.badly.comâ€™ is unlikely to get you much credit.</p>

<p>First of all, COM was originally meant for commercial organizations, try picking something more appropriate (assuming there is no company called Badly, Inc).</p>

<p>The â€˜this.suxâ€™ part is vanity. It contains one â€˜unusedâ€™ dot. It also relays a message, while the IRCNAME field or PRIVMSG should be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>The longer your hostname is (and the less use it is / the more offending it is), the more likely it is to get cut off IRC.</p>

<h2 id="5-one-client-should-be-enough-for-everyone">5) One client SHOULD be enough for everyone</h2>
<p>There is no need for you to have eight â€˜screenedâ€™ IRC-sessions or bots on one single IRC-server. It does not serve a purpose.</p>

<p>Maybe you need two - one client on a UNIX-box, one on Windows. But that should already cover it. Definitely. If you need to run a bot, just run one. Nobody will want to take over a very tiny channel that nobody really goes to. This is the case with most user-created ones.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if it has a huge load of bots, the people taking it over will :</p>

<p>Think itâ€™s big and thus â€˜â€˜worthâ€™â€™ taking over.
There is a challenge. They want to fight with your army of 50 bots. Itâ€™s just about the same as provocating them.</p>

<h2 id="6-you-should-keep-your-bots-off-botnets">6) You SHOULD keep your bots off botnets</h2>
<p>Botnets on IRC do not serve a direct purpose. In the end, you will see you were actually handing out the control of your bots to a bigger, more organized hacking/war-group. You wonâ€™t want that.</p>

<p>The fact somebody was abusing your access to a â€˜bncâ€™ or â€˜eggdropâ€™ is of no excuse. It was your own stupidity to hand out the pass in the first place. Who knows, maybe youâ€™ll do it again? By accident?</p>

<h2 id="7-you-must-keep-yourself-away-from-the-clans-groups-and-crews">7) You MUST keep yourself away from the clans, groups and crews</h2>
<p>If you wish to form a group, do it on Quake. Or if you want to kill somebody, try doing it on Q2 instead.</p>

<p>There are not many things that are black and white to operators. Groups, on the other hand, manage to fit there.</p>

<p>Very few operators want any connections to any groups. Asking them to join your group would be more or less a suicide (theyâ€™ll get upset at you for belonging to one, anyway).</p>

<p>Not being a groupie includes not joining or operating any of the questionable channels. At least if you want to stay on the safe sideâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="8-you-should-keep-your-ircname-field-tidy">8) You SHOULD keep your IRCNAME-field tidy</h2>
<p>In addition to belonging to groups, setting an IRC-name of the â€˜IRC-war since 1998â€™ kind, is suicidal. Especially if it contains all that elite- talk (numbers as letters).</p>

<h2 id="9-you-should-run-your-clients-with-proper-nicknames">9) You SHOULD run your clients with proper nicknames</h2>
<p>You mailing us, telling your client â€˜}[004010â€™ got K:lined will, at most make us grin. What is the idea with not picking a proper nickname? That doesnâ€™t look like anything but a clone or abuser to the lot of us.</p>

<h2 id="10-you-must-not-become-a-nuisance">10) You MUST not become a nuisance</h2>
<p>Nobody wants to provide a free service to somebody doing nothing but annoying others.</p>

<p>Being a nuisance is, ultimately, the most efficient way of earning a big, permanent ban.
